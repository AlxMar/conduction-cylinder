  Solving heat equation in cylindrical geometry with BOUT++

  data1           Contains BOUT.inp configuration file for a cylindrical geometry with the AXIAL magnetic field direction.


  data2           Contains BOUT.inp configuration file for a cylindrical geometry with the RADIAL magnetic field direction
                  (currently not working, see results2).

  results1        Some results for the "data1" setup.
  
  
  results2        Some results for the "data2" setup.
  
  
  comparsion.py   Can plot the results and compare to the analytical solution.
